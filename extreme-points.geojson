Cafeteria is awesome and every table has a nice TV to watch your favorite movie or program and there is an area to play with all the available PS, so definitively a cool place to visit if you are allowed to enter or work if you are passionate about the consoles and gaming in general, plus location is great close to a nice lake where you can go for a walk during lunch time. <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?currentCompany=%5B%221252%22%2C%221254%22%5D&geoUrn=%5B%22102095887%22%2C%2290000084%22%5D&origin=FACETED_SEARCH' target='_blank'>California's SIE Family!</a>",
